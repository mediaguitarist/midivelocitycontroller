# midivelocitycontroller

This is just a basic velocity controller for MIDI input. Nothing fancy. 

It's built with Juce and targeted at OSX. If you aren't already familiar with Juce. Then just open the Juce file then click "save project and open in XCode". Once it's open in XCode, just build and run. Should be available from there as it should automatically build into your VST directory. If you want build this into an AU, there will be more work that I didn't bother with on this go around.
